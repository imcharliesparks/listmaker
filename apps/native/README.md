# Clerk Auth Template

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), [Clerk](https://go.clerk.com/gjgxNgT), and [React Native Reusables](https://reactnativereusables.com).

It was initialized using the following command:

```bash
npx @react-native-reusables/cli@latest init -t native
```

## Getting Started

Before running the app, make sure to:

1. [Set up your Clerk account](https://go.clerk.com/blVsQlm)
2. In the instance setup, leave the default option selected: **Email, phone, username**
3. Enable Apple, GitHub, and Google as sign-in options under SSO Connections
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and paste your `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from [your API keys](https://go.clerk.com/u8KAui7)

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
